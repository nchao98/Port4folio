# Port4folio

As a user, I want to submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and 2 example homework assignments, an updated Github profile with pinned repos featuring Project 1 and 2 example assignments, an updated resume and an updated LinkedIn profile.
The updated Portfolio should include:
1. Displayed contact info (phone number, email, etc)
2. Have links to your GitHub and LinkedIn profile
3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume
4. Display 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks.

The deployed work must have:
1. Project title
2. Link to the deployed version
3. Link to the GitHub repository
4. Screenshot of the deployed application
